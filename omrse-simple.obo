comment: We are aware of the fact that Wikipedia's definition differs from ours by saying that "Legal personality (...) is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of personhood" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality) \nHowever, Shaw explicates:\n"In any legal system, certain entities, whether they be individuals or companies, will be regarded as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. Thus an individual may prosecute or be prosecuted for assault and a company can sue for breach of contract. They are able to do this because the law recognises them as 'legal persons' possessing the capacity to have and to maintain certain rights, and being subject to perform specific duties. (...) In municipal law individuals, limited companies and public corporations are recognized as each possessing a distinct legal personality, the terms of which are circumscribed by the relevant legislation" (Shaw MN: International Law. Sixth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008).                We hold that Shaw's position is ontological more prolific since it not only allows to explain how groups of individuals become recognized as unities at law, but also how different individuals can hold different legal personality roles (always against the context of one legal system). The latter will proof useful when dealing with the representing comatous patients or minorsat law in ontologies.

comment: Broadened from treatment to healthcare services generally.  "Low intensity" is not defined at the moment, but is needed to differentiate from same-day surgery centers or observation stays in hospitals that last <24 hours.  The idea is that few invasive procedures are performed, and the ones that are invasive are not typically much worse than a blood draw.  Maybe bone marrow biopsy is as aggressive as it gets.  I wonder if hematologists do that on an outpatient basis.

[]
comment: We include (i)-(iii) to acknowledge that there are different senses of "identify" that are relevant here, and that we may not always be sure which sense the person concretizing the social identity information content entity intended. While (i) concerns how one thinks of oneself, (ii) and (iii) are more focused on one's interactions with others. Importantly, some choose not to share with others how they identify in the sense of (i). For example, one can consider oneself to be some certain gender without either wanting others to know or choosing to present oneself in a corresponding way. We distinguish (ii) and (iii) because one can prefer to be regarded some certain way without attempting to present oneself in any corresponding way.

comment: It covers prescription claims because pharmacies bill insurance companies for patientsโ prescriptions via submitting insurance claims.
comment: The insurance claim is submitted to the insurance company by either the patient or the provider. It is not necessarily always the provider, although in the United States, it typically is.
comment: The outcome of the adjudication of a claim in the claims dataset could be favorable or unfavorable for the healthcare provider, the patient, or both. The idea is just that theyโve been adjudicated, one way or the other (or anything in between if thatโs a possibility).
comment: The reason we say billing data are only part of the input is because we are not conflating the insurance claim with the bill. It is our understanding that the providerโs bill of services is either part of the claim or โattachedโ to it in some manner, but doesnโt constitute the entire claim itself.
comment: The sources of these data are held by insurers or other health plan providers.

[]
comment: An interesting question is whether there must be another participant who is the "educator".  Some might object that many people are "self taught".  A real case of being self taught is the first person who learned to play a stringed instrument, or to spin a ball on the top of a finger.  There was no previous information about that.  The ICEs acquired are via one's sensory systems (vision, proprioception, auditory, etc.).\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of those who are self-taught by reading books or watching videos, or acquiring some other form of ICEs concretized outside their brain, one argument might be that the author of those ICEs somehow "plays a role" in the education, although they cannot participate in the education process itself (If I read Aristotle, and through repeated application of the information I acquire through doing so, develop the ability to write better ontology definitions, surely Aristotle did not actively participate in my particular education process, although he did influence it in a very real way).

comment: This class refers extremely broadly to the successful realization of any program of education: a single course, first grade, MD, PhD, high school, the ninth grade, getting a black belt in karate, getting a master mechanic certification, a bachelor's degree, a masters degree, a graduate certificate, early childhood education program, and even getting a certificate at the end of some week-long workshop, summer camp, a certifcate from a cooking class, an actuarial certification.

comment: It can still have action specifications as parts, and possibly other ICEs as parts.  That's why we cannot say it has only primary education objectives as parts, and we have to introduce the double negative in the class axiom.
comment: Primary education provides learning and educational activities typically designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics (i.e. literacy and numeracy), and to establish a sound foundation for learning and solid understanding of core areas of knowledge and personal development, preparing for lower secondary education. It aims at learning at a basic level of complexity with little if any specialisation.

It also covers a wide variety of non-formal and informal public and private activities intended to meet the basic learning needs of people of all ages.

Such programs may have work-based components (e.g. apprenticeships, dual-system education programmes). Successful completion of such programs leads to labor market-relevant, vocational qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labor market.
